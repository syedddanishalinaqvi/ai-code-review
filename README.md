# AI Code Reviews — Context-Aware GitHub App

**AI Code Reviews** is a **context-aware GitHub App** that performs intelligent code reviews by understanding the **entire repository**, not just the lines changed in a pull request.

Unlike traditional AI reviewers that only analyze diffs, this product builds a **semantic understanding of the full codebase** using embeddings and a vector database, enabling **high-quality, relevant, and maintainable review suggestions**.

## Product Vision

Modern code reviews require **context**:
- Existing architecture
- Utility functions
- Design patterns
- Prior implementation decisions

**AI Code Reviews** solves this by indexing the full repository and using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver reviews that feel like they came from a senior engineer who already knows the codebase.
